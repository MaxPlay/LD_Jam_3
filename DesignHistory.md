- Initial drafting of the map. I drew it on my whiteboard and wanted to do a quick blockout
- The idea is that the map is split in the center by a large building, dividing it into 5 "rooms"
  - The two areas in which the end/start is located
  - The two areas in which the carts are pushed above each other by the two teams
  - The central area in which the carts actually meet on one level
