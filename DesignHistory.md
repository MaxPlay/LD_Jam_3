- Initial drafting of the map. I drew it on my whiteboard and wanted to do a quick blockout
- The idea is that the map is split in the center by a large building, dividing it into 5 "rooms"
  - The two areas in which the end/start is located
  - The two areas in which the carts are pushed above each other by the two teams
  - The central area in which the carts actually meet on one level

 - Resized the walls overall to match the proper height for the characters
 - Updated layout on the start/end areas for the cart
   - It is more interesting to use now
   - It got more covers to work with (both see-through and occluding)
   - It has more options to get up to the rails
 - Reworked the way the carts meet in the center
   - Because of the mirror-like approach in level building, just letting the carts switch was not an option. One team would just remain "up" and the other "down" with their cart. Instead, there will be a track that the players can actively change (somehow, I am not certain how that works, yet) to "complete" one of the routes. The cart can only continue if the track is on their side.
